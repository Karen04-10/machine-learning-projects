# CNN Image Classification

## Project Type
Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Network)

## Description
Classifies images into multiple categories using CNN. Includes training, validation, and single image prediction.

## Dataset
Image dataset organized into directories per class (trainingSet and testSet)

## Skills & Tools
- Python (TensorFlow / Keras)
- CNN layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
- Image preprocessing with ImageDataGenerator

## How to Run
1. Run `digit_rec.ipynb`
2. Outputs training/validation accuracy and predictions for new images

## Results / Visualizations
- Accuracy and loss plots
- Predicted classes for new images
- Single image prediction example
